# Hi, I'm @andresjpb

I'm interested in software development, both front-end and back-end, and exploring new tecnologies that solve the needs of people.

I'm currently learning about artificial intelligence but I haven't chosen a specific topic to work on, I'm exploring the library OpenCV and its amazing results.

```
I'm looking to collaborate on agile and innovative projects.
